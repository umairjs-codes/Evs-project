<p>
Tundra plants survive in one of the harshest climates on Earth.
These plants grow in frozen soil, strong winds, and limited sunlight conditions.
</p>

<h2>Growth Characteristics</h2>

<p>
Most tundra plants grow low to the ground to avoid wind damage and retain heat.
They also grow quickly during the short summer growing season.
</p>

<h2>Types of Tundra Plants</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mosses</li>
<li>Lichens</li>
<li>Dwarf shrubs</li>
<li>Grasses and sedges</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adaptations</h2>

<p>
Many tundra plants develop waxy leaves to prevent moisture loss.
Some grow hair-like structures to trap heat and reduce wind exposure.
