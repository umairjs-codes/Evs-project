<p>
The Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) is one of the most well-adapted animals living in tundra environments.
It survives in some of the coldest habitats on Earth where temperatures often fall below freezing for most of the year.
</p>

<h2>Physical Adaptations</h2>

<p>
The Arctic fox has thick insulating fur that changes color with seasons.
During winter, the coat becomes white to blend with snow and avoid predators.
In summer, it changes to brown or gray for camouflage.
</p>

<h2>Habitat and Lifestyle</h2>

<p>
Arctic foxes live across Arctic tundra regions including Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia.
They build underground dens and often follow polar bears to scavenge leftover food.
</p>

<h2>Diet</h2>

<p>
They feed on small mammals, birds, eggs, insects, and occasionally marine animals.
Their ability to survive on limited food sources makes them important tundra predators.
